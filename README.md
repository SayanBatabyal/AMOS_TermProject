<h1> Adavanced Mechanics of Solids </h1>
<h3> Term Project </h1>

This repository contains all the materials used and developed to complete the term project of **Advanced Mechanics of Solids**. Most of the codework is performed in Jupyter Notebook. The report is written in LaTex.

In the upcoming time, the README will be updated with the problem statement and how we intend to tackle them.
